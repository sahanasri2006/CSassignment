Prompt:
"Write a highly optimized C++ program using 'using namespace std;' to find prime numbers in a given range (rl to rh). The program must use multiprocessing (fork) to utilize all available logical cores. Each child process should handle a chunk of the range. The results (prime numbers) should be written to a file 'prime.txt' using low-level file handling (open/write) for speed. Also, measure and print the physical execution time. Avoid comments and keep indentation minimal."
